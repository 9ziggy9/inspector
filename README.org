** TODO
- Implement geocoding via address: possible api is nominatim
***  Script ID files are not exposed in this repo for security purposes.
*** Building (look at Makefile)
- The build architecture here is some what unique--Makefile is used to checkout the production branch into a git worktree before building and bundling into a webpack.
- The project can also be build locally, so long as one has a mechanism of serving the build directory. I simply used in-build python3 http module.
  #+BEGIN_SRC console
  $ make local
  $ cd ./dist
  $ python3 -m "http.server" 9001
  #+END_SRC
